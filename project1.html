            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated student with a strong foundation in technology, finance, and data analytics, currently maintaining a 3.8 GPA at Rutgers University, where I serve as a board member for the BAPS Campus Fellowship (BCF). Set to graduate in May 2026, I am passionate about leveraging my skills to inspire and empower the next generation of leaders. Outside of academics, I am an avid rock climber and traveler, always seeking new challenges and experiences. I’ve also led a student-driven initiative to develop a financial literacy program for underprivileged high school students, combining my academic knowledge with real-world impact.</p>
